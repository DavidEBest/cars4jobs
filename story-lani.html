        <p>Lani has never taken the easy road.</p>

        <p>She learned early how to adapt, how to persevere, and how to keep moving even when the future felt uncertain. She balanced school, part-time jobs, and the emotional weight of building a future largely on her own.</p>

        <p>College wasn't just a goal. It was a promise she made to herself that her story would be defined by where she was going, not where she had been.</p>

        <p>But there was one obstacle standing in her way: reliable transportation.</p>

        <p>Through Impact Garage, a vehicle was re-homed to Lani. It wasn't brand new. It had miles on it and a story of its own. But it was dependable, carefully inspected, and repaired by technicians and volunteers who believe reliable transportation can change lives.</p>

        <p>With keys in hand, Lani headed off to college, the beginning of her next chapter and the future she's worked so hard to build.</p>

        <p><em>Because sometimes the difference between a dream and a degree is simply a way to get there.</em></p>
