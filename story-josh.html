      <div class="story-body">
        <p>Josh went through a difficult season that disrupted his stability and set him back in ways he never expected.</p>

        <p>Determined to rebuild, he made the decision to seek help and commit to a structured inpatient program. Completing that program marked a turning point, one where he chose growth, accountability, and a fresh start.</p>

        <p>From there, Josh connected with The Equity Center, where he gained skills, training, and meaningful employment. Through their support and his own determination, he completed the program and secured a position with a local manufacturing company. For the first time in years, he had steady employment and a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

        <p>What he still didn't have was reliable transportation.</p>

        <p>Josh had not owned a vehicle in over five years. Without a car, maintaining work, managing appointments, and handling daily responsibilities required extra time, planning, and stress.</p>

        <p>When Impact Garage re-homed a dependable vehicle to Josh, it represented freedom and stability.</p>

        <p>Today, Josh isn't defined by his past challenges. He's defined by resilience, growth, and momentum &mdash; and now, he has the reliable transportation to keep moving forward.</p>
