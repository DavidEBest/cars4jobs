      <p class="story-subtitle">Time Given Back</p>

      <div class="story-body">
        <p>For more than a year, Karaha spent hours each day on the bus, traveling to work, to school, and to the hospital to visit his young daughter as she bravely fought cancer.</p>

        <p>Long routes. Missed connections. Late nights.</p>

        <p>He was exhausted, but he never stopped. His family needed him. Time was the one thing he never had enough of.</p>

        <p>When Impact Garage re-homed a reliable vehicle to Karaha, everything changed. Long bus rides became direct drives. Hours were given back to him each day, hours spent at his daughter's bedside, supporting his wife, simply being present.</p>

        <p>The car brought more than transportation. It brought rest. It brought strength. It brought freedom.</p>

        <p>Today, his daughter has been cured of cancer, a victory their family will carry forever. And through one of the hardest seasons of their lives, reliable transportation helped Karaha stay close, stay strong, and stay together.</p>
