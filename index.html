      <h3>Problem Statements</h3>

      <div class="problem-statements">
        <div class="problem-statement">
          <p><strong>For employers:</strong> Manufacturing and logistics employers face persistent workforce challenges driven by transportation barriers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Missed shifts and tardiness due to unreliable transit</li>
            <li>High turnover among frontline and entry-level workers</li>
            <li>Limited hiring radius in car-dependent regions</li>
            <li>Lost productivity and increased training costs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-statement">
          <p><strong>For individuals:</strong> The difference between keeping a job and losing one has nothing to do with effort &mdash; it has everything to do with access. A lack of reliable transportation often blocks accepting a job, advancement, and long-term financial stability.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">What We Do</h3>
      <p>Cars4Work partners with qualified employers and workforce development programs to identify and assist individuals whose employability/employment status is dependent on having reliable, affordable transportation. The process is intentionally structured and employer-supported, ensuring accountability and long-term success. <strong>The result is reduced absenteeism, improved retention, and expansion of the available labor pool.</strong></p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Long-Term Vision</h3>
      <p><em>Cars4Work becomes a standard workforce infrastructure program that provides a bridge between employment, mobility, and economic stability.</em></p>
